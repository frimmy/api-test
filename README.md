========

###This repo has been created to test out API keys!

Originally posted on [here](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/09/beginners-guide-jquery-based-json-api-clients/comment-page-1/#comment-988706 "Smashing") as an intro tutorial to using API via The Movie Db's api. 

Unfortunately, it was updated to version 3.0 in October rendering the tutorial out of date. So I decided to muck around and get it working again!

##You can check out the working project [here](http://frimmy.github.io/api-test "TMDb Api project")

Let me know if you have suggestions for refactoring, cheers
