api-test
========

###This repo has been created to test out API keys!

Originally posted on [here](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/09/beginners-guide-jquery-based-json-api-clients/comment-page-1/#comment-988706 "Smashing") as an intro tutorial to using API via The Movie Db's api. 

Unfortunately, it was updated to version 3.0 in October rendering the tutorial out of date. So I decided to muck around and get it working again!

##You can check out the working project [here](http://frimmy.github.io/api-test "TMDb Api project")

Special thanks to [Adrien](https://github.com/adrienp "His github") for help on better submission event handling!

Feel free to fork/make pull requests for refactoring.

I'd like to turn this project into a tutorial in the near future, let me know if you'd like to help @ [my email](mailto:adrian.frimpong@gmail.com?Subject=Api%20test%20tutorial-help)

Cheers!
